# Predicting Housing Prices using Machine Learning

This notebook looks into using various Pythong-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predictig the median home value for a home in a Calfornian suburb.

This dataset was obtained from the StatLib repository. https://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~ltorgo/Regression/cal_housing.html. It can be downloaded/loaded using the sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing function.

Features
This dataset was derived from the 1990 U.S. census, using one row per census block group. A block group is the smallest geographical unit for which the U.S. Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people).

8 numeric, predictive attributes and the target

1. MedInc median income in block group

2. HouseAge median house age in block group

3. AveRooms average number of rooms per household

4. AveBedrms average number of bedrooms per household

5. Population block group population

6. AveOccup average number of household members

7. Latitude block group latitude

8. Longitude block group longitude
